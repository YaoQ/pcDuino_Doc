# HDMI Touch Screen for 96boards

Recently, I get an 7inch HDMI touch screen and the features of this screen are:
* 800Ã—480 high resolution
* Capacitive touch control
* Supports Raspberry Pi
* Supports Banana Pi / Banana Pro, comes with Lubuntu, Raspbian images
* Supports BB Black, comes with Angstrom image
* For other mini-PCs, driver is required and should be developed by users
* Not only for mini-PCs, it can work as a computer monitor * just like any other general HDMI screen
* HDMI interface for displaying, USB interface for touch control
* Back light control to lower power consumption

The screen use standard HID protocol, so it is very easy to be integrated into Linux system. So the following I will introduce is about how to use it with DragonBoard410c which is one kind of 96boards.
